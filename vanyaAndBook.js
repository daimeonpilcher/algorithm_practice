// Vanya got an important task — he should enumerate the books in the library and label each book with its number. Each of the n books should be assigned with a number from 1 to n. Naturally, each book should have a unique number.

// Vanya wants to know how many digits he will have to write down as he labels the books. Your task is to help him!

// Example

// For n = 13, the output should be
// VanyaAndBook1s(n) = 17.

// The books should be labeled with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, which totals to 17 digits.

// Input/Output

// [time limit] 4000ms (js)
// [input] integer n

// The number of books in the library.

// Constraints:
// 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^8

function VanyaAndBook1s(n) {
		
}

console.log(VanyaAndBook1s(100)); // 192
console.log(VanyaAndBook1s(1000)); // 2893
console.log(VanyaAndBook1s(244)); // 624
